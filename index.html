                Hello Everyone and welcome to my page! I assumed the Bio would be the easiest part of
                this assignment, however I'm having flashbacks to all the writer's block I used to
                experience in previous classes and can't seem to find words to make sentences. I've
                spent the last 8 years overworking myself, traveling whenever possible, and waiting on
                some higher power to force me down the right path (whatever that is).

                I am the middle child of 5. You are probably assuming that I was the typical
                "forgotten" child, and you are absolutely right! I didn't received the same level
                guidance and discipline as my ther siblings, but I don't think I turned out too bad.
                I've had to learn how to figure a lot of things out on my own, which helped me gain 
                independence, learning skills, and self motivation.

                My main study over the years has been foreign language, and coding definitely qualifies
                as a new foreign language to add to my list.
